Dikjstra Algorithm using C++ - CAO Kha Bao Khanh 2017

This is a code that I wrote to implement Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path of a graph.
The graph can be coded into nodes from 1 to n (n the number of nodes of the graph). 
The program will first ask the user to input the total number of nodes.
Then, it will ask for the distance between every nodes. Note that if the distance is 0, it means that the nodes are not connected. 
The program will output the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm.
This is not the best program in terms of optimality because I tried a lot of C++ functionalities out in my program to know how they work.
